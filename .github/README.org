* Giovanni's dotfiles
Dotfiles are the customization files used in Linux or other Unix-based systems to
personalize the system at your will.

** How to organize the dotfiles
To manage my dotfiles I use a git bare repository. REF: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
The trick is to store the git bare repository in a "side" folder (in my case $HOME/.dotfiles)
    using a specially crafted alias so that commands are run against that repository and
    not the usual .git local folder, which would interfere with any other git repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git init --bare $HOME/.dotfiles
# I added this command to config.fish, so it works also for fish shell
echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
git remote add origin https://github.com/giovannicemin/dotfiles.git
#+END_SRC


** My dotfiles
*** bashrc
*** fish
*** Doom Emacs
Stored in ./.doom.d these config are still quite vanilla.
 Nevertheless I do have some interesting tweaks added to my configs.
